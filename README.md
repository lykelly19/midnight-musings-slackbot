# midnight-musings-slackbot

Created for the late-night, midnight musings of the #interesting channel on the Coronavirus Visualization Team (CVT) Slack.   

The slackbot currently generates a random quote through a query to [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) whenever it is mentioned in a Slack channel.    

This slackbot app was deployed through [Heroku](https://heroku.com). The environmental variables are used in the Configure Variables section on the Heroku app dashboard Settings tab.

## More features and descriptions / set-up details to come!
